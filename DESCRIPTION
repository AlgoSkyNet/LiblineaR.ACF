Description: A wrapper around the LIBLINEAR C/C++ library for
    machine learning (available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear).
    LIBLINEAR is a simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear
    classification and regression. It currently supports L2-regularized
    classification (such as logistic regression, L2-loss linear SVM and L1-loss
    linear SVM) as well as L1-regularized classification (such as L2-loss linear
    SVM and logistic regression) and L2-regularized support vector regression
    (with L1- or L2-loss). The main features of LiblineaR include multi-class
    classification (one-vs-the rest, and Crammer & Singer method), cross
    validation for model selection, probability estimates (logistic regression
    only) or weights for unbalanced data. The estimation of the models is
    particularly fast as compared to other libraries.
